Workers, families, and communities must be protected against this deadly substance."
Democrat,We have seen tragic—and too often deadly—consequences of restricting abortion care in the 9 months since SCOTUS overturned Roe. We need the #WHPA to restore and strengthen reproductive right protections in our country.
Democrat,"Banning books, preventing educators from teaching accurate history, and hiding images of Michelangelo's David won't keep students and educators safe. Reinstating the assault weapons ban will. https://t.co/I1Rd3TaES0"
Democrat,Using the force of law to attack trans children and deprive them of the care they need is wrongheaded and dangerous. Politicians should not use their power to control the personal lives of trans kids and their families.
Democrat,"It was great to join advocates (and a shark) to celebrate the ocean! We made good progress last Congress to protect coastal communities and ocean health, and I look forward to continuing our work. https://t.co/k9WLKVhpMz"
Democrat,"Abortion care is necessary, lifesaving care. Restricting someone’s ability to travel to receive an abortion in another state, as this proposed bill would do, is dangerous, wrong, and deeply concerning. https://t.co/HdHRh1QakM"
Democrat,"I’ve seen the toll this disease takes. Several members of my family had lung cancer—including my mother and mother-in-law, and my stepfather, who passed away shortly after his diagnosis."
Democrat,"I support @LungAssociation’s work to #TurnTheHillTurquoise and raise awareness about lung cancer. We can improve outcomes for patients by improving methods of prevention, early detection, treatments, and expanding quality and affordable healthcare. https://t.co/KooFqIYbRo"
Democrat,"It’s a package of bad pro-fossil fuel policies that will eviscerate environmental protections, won’t help lower energy costs, and will add more than $2 billion to the deficit. I’m voting no."
Democrat,"Scientists have made it clear that there are only two options: significantly cut emissions now or face catastrophic challenges ahead.

The Republicans’ energy bill puts polluters over people and is a dangerous move in the wrong direction. https://t.co/SDfr6IC0Fi"
Democrat,Submissions are due by 4/28. Details about how to participate are here: https://t.co/1kHBzXrjrG
Democrat,"It’s time for the 2023 Congressional Art Competition!

The competition is an annual celebration of the talented student artists in our district and across the country. I look forward to seeing what students create this year. https://t.co/zPvBTvPhLk"
Democrat,Scientists agree that a rapid transition away from fossil fuels is the only feasible way to meet emissions reduction goals— a fact that too many of my colleagues seem to ignore. We cannot continue to let the fossil fuel industry stand in the way of meaningful climate action.
Democrat,"Helping kids get enough to eat is a good investment, and I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to support the USDA's requested funding."
Democrat,"The Healthy Meals, Healthy Kids Act, a bill I introduced with Rep. @BobbyScott, would put these updated eligibility provisions into law."
Democrat,I applaud the Biden administration’s proposal to expand access to healthy school meals for all. The current standards for schools are out of step with the actual needs that school nutrition staff see among the students they serve.
Democrat,"The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was a step in the right direction, but that law is not enough to prevent the tragedies that are far too common in our country. We must do more to end gun violence."
Democrat,"All students should have the right to attend a safe, nurturing, and supportive school free from the threat of gun violence."
Democrat,"According to the Gun Violence Archive, more than 4,000 people have already died from gun violence this year – not including those who died by suicide."
Democrat,My thoughts are with the Nashville students and families affected by this horrific shooting. Congress cannot sit by as yet another community is torn apart by gun violence.
Democrat,"Time to vote on my Bill of Rights #ForStudentandParents, which has support from parents, teachers, and more than 250 education and civil rights organizations across the country. https://t.co/YiDgAFLzMs"
Democrat,"Speaker McCarthy, stop talking as if your bill is already law. Plus it doesn’t address the needs of all parents and will hurt, not help, students. https://t.co/atLynhfAzO"

Democrat,We must continue to support the National Estuary Program.

Democrat,"Shamefully, my colleagues across the aisle are encouraging and exploiting the stigma and discrimination faced by trans kids. Outing trans kids and policing what restrooms they use, as the Politics over Parents Act would do, is a dangerous abuse of power."
Democrat,"Trans kids are some of the most vulnerable students in our schools. Many struggle with mental health challenges and suicidal thoughts—not because they are trans, but because of how they’re treated."
Democrat,"In rejecting both, House Republicans made clear that they are not interested in working on the real issues facing our schools."
Democrat,"I worked with a broad and diverse group of organizations representing students, parents, and educators to create a Bill of Rights that is actually #ForStudentsAndParents and a substitute amendment that would facilitate authentic family engagement."
Democrat,"Despite its misleading title, the bill my colleagues on the other side of the aisle narrowly pushed through will not grant any new rights and does not represent what the vast majority of public school parents want or need."
Democrat,"I was excited when I heard we were considering a bill about parent involvement in education. 

But instead of fostering meaningful collaboration between parents and educators, H.R.5 puts politics over parents."
Democrat,"Today is the anniversary of March for Our Lives. I’m glad to join my Oregon colleagues, @RepSalinas and @RepValHoyle, in working to end gun violence. #StillMarching https://t.co/EfOnXCP61d"
Democrat,I am offering a substitute that will use evidence-based programs and practices to involve more parents in a collaborative rather than adversarial way. I worked on this with the input of stakeholders who are in our public schools every day.
Democrat,"Today we are considering the partisan so-called ‘Parents Bill of Rights,’ which should be called the ‘Politics Over Parents Act.’ 

As a parent who was very involved in public education for 15 years, I support parental involvement in education - but this bill misses the mark. https://t.co/21qhmUvTMK"
Democrat,"After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement in education. The Politics over Parents Act does not; it treats parents as adversaries rather than partners. https://t.co/RjuMSGiKlp"
Democrat,"Last Congress, we passed the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act to made improvements to coverage and benefits. We must continue to work toward  universal healthcare coverage."
Democrat,"Today, despite repeated attempts by the other side of the aisle to repeal or eliminate the law, more people than ever are enrolled under ACA."
Democrat,"13 years ago President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Since then, millions of Americans have benefitted from better health care coverage and lower costs."
Democrat,House Republicans’ draconian proposed budget cuts would leave seniors hungry and kick working Americans out of their homes. Their proposal is needlessly cruel and fiscally unsound. https://t.co/7MyRNJn87S

Democrat,"This is urgent. Top climate scientists serve on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (@IPCC_CH), and they just issued a new report urging action now. https://t.co/VfAZKf07nB"
Democrat,"No one should go hungry in the United States. SNAP is our most effective anti-hunger program, and we have the opportunity to strengthen it in this year’s Farm Bill. https://t.co/0TeDjP4Xk1"
Democrat,"It would be unconscionable to end access to a drug that people have used safely used for more than 20 years.

The overturning of Roe has emboldened attacks on reproductive freedom. Congress must pass the Women’s Health Protection Act and restore protections for abortion care."
Democrat,Congress should continue to build on this progress and lower the cost of other prescription drugs.
Democrat,The Inflation Reduction Act capped the cost of insulin at $35 per month for Medicare recipients; now all major insulin makers in the U.S. will do the same so everyone who uses insulin can benefit. https://t.co/oCfkOLOOGF
Democrat,"The expanded Child Tax Credit, universal school meals, and increased SNAP benefits are some of the bill’s temporary provisions that have long-term benefits and should be made permanent."
Democrat,The American Rescue Plan was more than just a stimulus package; it showed that our country has the ability to cut poverty and end hunger.
Democrat,"Congress passed the American Rescue Plan 2 years ago to provide a lifeline to many in this country during the worst parts of the pandemic. It helped families pay their bills, businesses stay afloat, and schools continue teaching. https://t.co/KjdGokiraR"

Democrat,"I join my @CAPAC colleagues in remembering the victims of the Atlanta attacks, and in renewing our commitment to opposing hate in all forms."
Democrat,The tragic events in Georgia remind us that the use of racist and xenophobic language too often fuels violence against marginalized communities.
Democrat,"Two years after eight people were senselessly murdered in Atlanta, we must continue to stand with AAPI communities and speak out against anti-Asian actions and sentiments. Shamefully, this includes rhetoric expressed by some of our own colleagues in Congress."
Democrat,Warrenton High School students who walk to school have to traverse a shoulder next to fast-moving traffic on Main Ave. The funding I advocated for will help build a sidewalk and improve crosswalks so this well-used route is safer for everyone. https://t.co/e6yiV8My4d
Democrat,"In considering the Republican’s so-called Parent’s Bill of Rights, my @EdWorkforceDems colleagues and I offered amendments to prevent the censorship of Black, Native American, LGBTQ, AAPI, Latino, and women’s history. My Republican colleagues rejected all of them."
Democrat,It is a disservice to deprive students of the opportunity to learn an accurate history of the United States because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle fear discussions of racism or other forms of bigotry.

Democrat,"The Biden Administration has taken historic steps to address the climate crisis, but the decision to approve the Willow oil drilling project is deeply disappointing. We must transition away from carbon polluting fossil fuels, and this will take us in the wrong direction."
